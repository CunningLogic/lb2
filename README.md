This library has been developed with the intent do receive all channels of the DJI Lightbridge 2 remote control with a Teensy(https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/), as the Lightbridge only transmits a limited number of inputs over SBUS.

This library should also work with any other Arduino compatible board.

This library relies on the FastCRC library (https://github.com/FrankBoesing/FastCRC).

Potentially, it could also be extended to communicate with the DJI A3 and with other DJI devices.

I appreciate any help for improving/extending this library.
